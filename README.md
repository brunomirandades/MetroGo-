# MetroGo!

This is a project which intends to develop an interface to be available in the self-service terminals in the trainstations of São Paulo‘s metro system.

Its intent is to make available for users of this metro system to find themselves through the stations, from their departure station to their arrival station.

It uses Python as the main programming language, alongside a SQL database to store information of the stations available in the system.

Python‘s Tkinter library was used to develop the GUI, and the database was developed using SQLite3.

# Software Features

From the Departure and Arrival fields it is possible to set the corresponding stations and show the route the user needs to go through:



There is also a map of the full metro system available, so the user can locate stations within the system:
